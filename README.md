## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

1. We learn to deploy to GitHub.

2. We learn more about CSS properties.

Use overflow to hide the scroll bar.

```css
.card {
  overflow: hidden;
  flex-direction: column;
  height: 40rem;
  width: 22rem;
  border-radius: 15px;
}
```

Hide an element.

```css
.desktop-image {
  display: none;
}
```

Line-through words

```css
.word {
  text-decoration: line-through;
}
```

### Continued development

- Improve the mobile responsive skills.
- Practice more with flexbox.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_text_decoration.asp) - Add line-through text decoration.
- [Resource 2](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/a-complete-guide-to-submitting-solutions-on-frontend-mentor-ac6384162248) - Explain how to deploy to GitHub.

We work together and we discuss what we can do, how we can do. This is the first frontend mentor project for both of us and we do learn a lot.
